# GraphQL Test Project ðŸš€

Welcome to my GraphQL test project! ðŸ‘‹ This project has been created with the goal of exploring and learning more about GraphQL and its implementation in web applications.

## Description

The main objective of this project is to build a GraphQL API that allows the following actions:

- [x] Query a list of words.
- [x] Translate words to different languages using the DeepL API.
- [x] Add new words to our database.
- [x] Update and delete existing words.
- [x] And much more!

## Goals

- Learn how to design an efficient GraphQL schema.
- Practice creating resolvers to handle queries and mutations.
- Experiment with the integration of external services, such as DeepL.
- Understand how a GraphQL API is structured in TypeScript.
- Improve my skills in developing GraphQL-based applications.

## Technologies Used

- GraphQL
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- DeepL API
- And many others!
